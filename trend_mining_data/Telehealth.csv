This unique approach is possible by providing an advanced telemedicine unit for use by the physician specialist that is geographically remote from the patient and his current lower level of care facility.

P,Real Time Multispecialty Telehealth Interactive Patient Wellness Portal (IPWP),"A novel telehealth video conferencing system (process) that is designed to enable the patient user to have a real-time or near real-time 2 way tele-conference/consult including the transfer of patient specific biometric information with a health care provider team (one or more health care providers simultaneously, i.e. a team consisting of a pharmacist, physician, mental health provider, clinical lab, mental health provider, orthopedist, podiatrist, dentist, clinical specialist, etc. . . . ) located remotely from the telehealth digital/video patient user portal. The present invention, the IPWP is an interactive-digital health care provider network to patient portal designed to provide patients with the same level of quality care that they would expect to receive if they were physically in a multispecialty doctor or health care providers' (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, dentist, ophthalmologist, orthopedist, podiatrist, medical specialty clinic, hospital, etc. . . . ) office. However, the patients that utilize the IPWP will interact with their health care provider/s on a computer/notebook/smart device screen/monitor via existing secure digital web or cellular camera technology in a mobile or stationary, enclosed/private HIPP compliant environment at a retail pharmacy or a pharmacy supported location (workplace, educational facilities, retail stores, etc. . . . that have an in-house, adjacent or an electronic dispensing pharmacy). Current statistics demonstrate that 80% of primary care provider visits result in the health care provider writing a script for medication. Medication management is critical to safe, effective quality care and has been an issue of health care reforms Accountable Care Organization concept since 2009. In order for the patient to receive comparable care to what they would receive in a multispecialty provider/doctor's office with an onsite pharmacy, the IMP will combine the use of existing biometric sensor technologies (i.e. Strain Gauge Tech, IR Thermometer, etc.) in order for the system to take patient real time biometric information such as height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, EKG, blood glucose, body temperature, etc. . . . as well as identify the patient positively by both video capture and biometric scanning (fingerprint, iris scan, driver's license photo, etc. . . . ). It also has the capability to upload information from certain glucose readers in order for the physician to better assess a patient's blood sugar levels and may incorporate the use of magnified micro camera technology and lighting to look at a patient's microanatomy (ear canals, nasal passages, skin conditions, color and eye examination, etc. . . . ). In addition to the use of sensor technology the IPWP can incorporate the use of antimicrobial materials or technologies (copper ions, silver ions, UV light, HEPA filters, etc. . . . ) to reduce the communication of disease from patient to patient. The monitor, web camera, and other vital components will be designed to be permanently or temporarily (mobile system) located within a secure/private enclosure at a pharmacy or pharmacy supported location (private kiosk, room, booth, enclosure, space, etc. . . . ). All patient information and electronic forms will be transmitted via a secure encrypted web based digital or cellular portal to multiple providers as needed simultaneously for a seamless 3-way (or more) consultation/communication. The IPWP will be linked to a smartphone/computer/Internet/web app that will allow the patient to view availability and schedule appointments at their local pharmacies IPWP or alternatively on a walk-in, as needed basis. Lastly, the unit will be equipped with electronic payment technologies such as card (swipe) readers, etc. . . . to capture/collect payment from credit cards, PayPal and debit cards for all health care services provided including, but limited to co-pays, payments, prescriptions, lab test, etc. . . . .In summary the ability of the patient portal system to provide real time, multiple simultaneously communicating health care providers with real time biometric information (including the onsite or tele pharmacist) is a novel process not limited to the single provider video/audio access currently patented. This new dimension to telehealth promises a telehealth experience that at a minimum matches the diagnostics ability and access of a multispecialty clinic or traditional hospital setting while exceeding the clinical/diagnostic ability of a single health care provider's office or clinic that is more accessible at a 50% reduced cost and resulting in better health outcomes.","1.

The command and control system uses computer graphic elements (e.g. icons) as telephysician identifiers. Each icon is unique in appearance and represents an individual service provider. Icons can be electronically inserted into queue diagrams represented at the presentation layer of the command and control system. Icons are archived in an icon library and linked to physician personnel records. These icons are used for many tasks including adding healthcare service providers to case work lists and sorting healthcare providers according to qualifications such as expertise.","1.

P,Integrated telemedicine computer system,"A patient medical monitor that can allow a health care provider to remotely monitor and assist a patient. The patient monitor may be coupled to a provider monitor by a network such as the Internet. The monitor may include a touch screen that displays large icons. Touching an icon may cause the monitor to transmit information to an external source. For example, touching a  HELP  icon may cause the monitor to dial an emergency phone number. The icons are large so that the patient can easily see and read the monitor. The monitor may have a plurality of output ports that can be coupled to medical sensing devices such as an electronic thermometer, pulse oximeter, stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, etc. The monitor can convert the input signals from the sensing devices into a format that can be transmitted through the network. The converted sensing input signals can be bundled with other personal data such as name, age, etc. of the patient so that the health provider can store the information and diagnostic data in a relational database","1.
